    <h1>Hello, {{ user }}!</h1>
    <h1>Here is a playlist for you!</h1>
    <p>The playlist given below is fully-customizable based on the audio features. It considers the artist that you had listened the most in the last month.</p>
    <br>


    <div class="playlists">
    <h2>Your Own Customized Playlist</h2>

    <h2>Playlist Features</h2>
    <p>You can use the bars below to arrange the features of your playlist.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li>
        <li>Energy: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. </li>
        <li>Speechiness: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. Higher values describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. </li>
        <li>Acousticness: Measures whether the track is acoustic. </li>
        <li>Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. </li>
        <li>Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.</li>
        <li>Valence: Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). </li>
        <li>Tempo: Estimates tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. </li>
    </ul>
